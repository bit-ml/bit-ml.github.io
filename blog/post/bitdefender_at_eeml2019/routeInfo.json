Beside\nthat, our own Elena Burceanu was one of the organizers of EEML, putting a lot\nof time and effort into making sure that every little detail will happen like\nclockwork.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/bitdefender_booth.jpg\" alt=\"bitdefender_booth\" title=\"Elena and Ștefan at the Bitdefender booth.\"></p>\n<p>EEML is a huge event so it was all hands on deck. Therefore we put the\nvolunteer yellow shirts on, took a deep breath, a sip of coffee and joined\nthe efforts. Our colleagues helped participants finding their way from the\nairport to the accommodation, prepared the welcome bags, they made sure every\nvideo projector works, and that there are spare batteries for the microphones\nin the lecture room.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/volunteers.jpg\" alt=\"eeml_volunteers\" title=\"EEML volunteers welcoming the participants.\"></p>\n<p>The summer school kicked off with a humorous presentation about the Romanian\nculture from our own Florin Brad. That moment provided everyone with the\nenergy to go through the full week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Florin's own words:</p>\n<h2>The lectures</h2>\n<p>The lectures at EEML covered a broad range of topics in Machine Learning\naiming to both build the theoretical foundations for the newcomers and also\nhint to the research frontiers in the domain.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the diverse background of the speakers enabled a wide variety of\nlectures, ranging from pragmatic descriptions of the latest research results\nto theoretical crash courses in the different areas covered by the summer\nschool.</p>\n<h2>Posters</h2>\n<p>EEML participants were encouraged to present their current work in a poster\nsession that spanned over two evenings (actually well into the night). That\nwas a great opportunity for them to get feedback from the seniors.</p>\n<p>Our team unveiled three internal research efforts. Iulia Duță and Andrei\nNicolicioiu presented their novel recurrent space-time graph neural networks\nfor video understanding (also accepted at NeurIPS!!!). Emanuela Haller\ndiscussed her work on spacetime graph optimization for video object\nsegmentation. Florin Gogianu introduced his idea to use uncertainty to\nprioritize past experiences for training agents through reinforcement\nlearning.</p>\n<h2>Teaching assistants</h2>\n<p>EEML practicals were challenging applications of the theory discussed during\nthe lectures. The subjects were quite diverse covering Image classification,\nreinforcement learning, recurrent neural nets for language models, or\ngenerative models such as variational autoencoders. The teaching assistants\nhad the job to guide the participants into solving this tasks, and leave the\nsummer school with a consistent experience in training deep neural models\nusing Tensorflow. The TAs were researchers from prestigious universities, and\ncompanies such as DeepMind, and Bitdefender.</p>\n<p>Our own colleagues, some of which are also teaching at University Politehnica\nof Bucharest or University of Bucharest (Iulia, Florin, Andrei, Ștefan, Ema,\nTudor) got involved in guiding the participants through the new stuff in each\nlaboratory.</p>\n<h2>Epilogue</h2>\n<p>EEML was a huge opportunity for Bucharest to join and interact with the\nrelevant actors in the machine learning community. Bitdefender is proud to be\nso deeply involved in bringing this event to our city.</p>\n"}}}
