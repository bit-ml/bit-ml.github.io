second edition of the Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School, this
year’s highlight event for our fast growing machine learning community in
Romania.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-eeml-">What is EEML?</h2>
<p>The EEML Summer School gathers top researchers from universities and
companies, offering an intensive week full of lectures and practicals to
participants ranging from undergrad students to post-doc researchers.</p>
<p>The summer school was successful in its mission to connect Eastern Europe
with the rest of the world, welcoming attendees from 42 different countries.
Being true to the schools values on inclusiveness, women represented almost a
third of the participants, more than the usual ratio encountered in STEM.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the national level, EEML offered the chance to meet and
strengthen the collaboration between research hubs in Iași, Cluj-Napoca,
Timișoara, and Brașov.</p>
<blockquote>
I like the fact that, although the school grows visibly in size, you still
have a chance to talk and share opinions with speakers and other
participants.
<footer>

</blockquote>


<p>Bringing everyone together for a full week makes EEML an ideal place to
exchange ideas with others working on similar topics, to draw inspiration
from others’ approach to their problems, and this adds a valuable extra to
the overall learning experience.</p>
<blockquote>
It&#x27;s been more than two months since I participated at EEML but the ideas
floated there and the relationships I started still seem highly relevant to
me - as should be the case for any good summer school. I fondly remember the
things I learned from David Nagy (<a href="https://twitter.com/dvgnagy">@dvgnagy</a>) on Bayesian reasoning, the
discussions I had with Rob (<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertTLange">@RobertTLange</a>) on RL, multi-agent
systems and much more or the reading suggestions on causal inference I got
from Jeroen Berrevoets (<a href="https://twitter.com/J_Berrevoets">@J_Berrevoets</a>). EEML also
facilitated starting a research collaboration with Błażej Osiński and Maciej
Wołczyk after discussing it over some beers.

<h2 id="bitdefender-among-organizers">Bitdefender among organizers</h2>
<p>EEML’s mission was laid out by a group of successful romanian researchers
that wanted to ensure eastern european talent pool gets access to the same
resources as the more established academic centers in the western world.
Doina Precup, Răzvan Pașcanu, and Viorica Pătrăucean were the leading
organizers of the summer school, and their dedication made everything
possible.</p>
<p>Bitdefender was one of the Gold Sponsors of EEML proving its commitment to
advance the local research community and invest in local education. Beside
that, our own Elena Burceanu was one of the organizers of EEML, putting a lot
of time and effort into making sure that every little detail will happen like
clockwork.</p>
<p><img src="https://bit-ml.github.io/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/bitdefender_booth.jpg" alt="bitdefender_booth" title="Elena and Ștefan at the Bitdefender booth."/></p>
<p>EEML is a huge event so it was all hands on deck. Therefore we put the
volunteer yellow shirts on, took a deep breath, a sip of coffee and joined
the efforts. Our colleagues helped participants finding their way from the
airport to the accommodation, prepared the welcome bags, they made sure every
video projector works, and that there are spare batteries for the microphones
in the lecture room.</p>
<p><img src="https://bit-ml.github.io/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/volunteers.jpg" alt="eeml_volunteers" title="EEML volunteers welcoming the participants."/></p>
<p>The summer school kicked off with a humorous presentation about the Romanian
culture from our own Florin Brad. That moment provided everyone with the
energy to go through the full week.</p>

<p>In Florin’s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
This year I held a five minute presentation about Romania during the opening
of the summer school. They say the best way to learn something is to explain
it to other people, so I hope people have learned one or two things about our
country (because I sure have).

<h2 id="the-lectures">The lectures</h2>
<p>The lectures at EEML covered a broad range of topics in Machine Learning
aiming to both build the theoretical foundations for the newcomers and also
hint to the research frontiers in the domain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the diverse background of the speakers enabled a wide variety of
lectures, ranging from pragmatic descriptions of the latest research results
to theoretical crash courses in the different areas covered by the summer
school.</p>
<h2 id="posters">Posters</h2>
<p>EEML participants were encouraged to present their current work in a poster
session that spanned over two evenings (actually well into the night). That
was a great opportunity for them to get feedback from the seniors.</p>
<blockquote>
It was a great opportunity to present my work at EEML, getting a chance to
share opinions with amazing people with varied expertise in computer vision.
This experience had a positive impact and helped me shape my next research
steps as many discussions brought a new perspective over my work.

</blockquote>

<p>Our team unveiled three internal research efforts. Iulia Duță and Andrei
Nicolicioiu presented their novel recurrent space-time graph neural networks
for video understanding (also accepted at NeurIPS!!!). Emanuela Haller
discussed her work on spacetime graph optimization for video object
segmentation. Florin Gogianu introduced his idea to use uncertainty to
prioritize past experiences for training agents through reinforcement
learning.</p>
<blockquote>
EEML also provided me with the opportunity of presenting my work on
Bayesian-inspired prioritization measures for the Experience Replay buffer
during one of the two poster sessions. It was actually my first
conference-like poster session I attended so it was a rather interesting
experience. I received some great suggestions from Diana Borsa which might
help me polish this research further and also got some follow-up questions
from the people I met there. Somehow I also got one of the Best Poster Awards
and that wrapped-up nicely the great experience I had attending EEML.

<h2 id="teaching-assistants">Teaching assistants</h2>
<p>EEML practicals were challenging applications of the theory discussed during
the lectures. The subjects were quite diverse covering Image classification,
reinforcement learning, recurrent neural nets for language models, or
generative models such as variational autoencoders. The teaching assistants
had the job to guide the participants into solving this tasks, and leave the
summer school with a consistent experience in training deep neural models
using Tensorflow. The TAs were researchers from prestigious universities, and
companies such as DeepMind, and Bitdefender.</p>
<blockquote>
For me, it was quite a different perspective this time, as I join the summer
school as a teaching assistant, an attribution that I loved to hold as it
gave me the opportunity, besides captivating lectures held by top researchers
all over the world, to interact more with participants and other TAs. It was
a great mix of receptive students, awesome devoted colleagues and a strong
team behind all the labs that prepares everything to be fun and valuable._

</blockquote>


<p>Our own colleagues, some of which are also teaching at University Politehnica
of Bucharest or University of Bucharest (Iulia, Florin, Andrei, Ștefan, Ema,
Tudor) got involved in guiding the participants through the new stuff in each
laboratory.</p>
<blockquote>
I am a teaching assistant at the university, but here it was way more
challenging given the hard topics and the smart and enthusiastic people
attending. Brilliant researchers were also acting as teaching assistants and
I really appreciate interacting with them during and before the labs. It was
very interesting to see how other TAs explain the topics they are experts
on.

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>EEML was a huge opportunity for Bucharest to join and interact with the
relevant actors in the machine learning community. Bitdefender is proud to be
so deeply involved in bringing this event to our city.</p>
<blockquote>
Facilitating new relations between like-minded researchers at the beginning
of their careers is not the only thing making EEML great. I felt I gained a
lot by participating or assisting in discussions with researchers like Răzvan
Pașcanu, Doina Precup, Andrei Rusu or Akata Zeynep. Simply hanging around
these people and hear them discussing any topic for 20 minutes can leave you
with tons of insights and problem formulations they&#x27;ve deeply thought about
and to which you could not have access to otherwise.

Our colleagues helped participants finding their way from the\nairport to the accommodation, prepared the welcome bags, they made sure every\nvideo projector works, and that there are spare batteries for the microphones\nin the lecture room.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/volunteers.jpg\" alt=\"eeml_volunteers\" title=\"EEML volunteers welcoming the participants.\"></p>\n<p>The summer school kicked off with a humorous presentation about the Romanian\nculture from our own Florin Brad. That moment provided everyone with the\nenergy to go through the full week.</p>\n<!-- ![florin_brad](/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/florin_brad.jpg \"Florin Brad giving the tour.\") -->\n\n<p><img src=\"/galleries/eeml2019_pictures/florin_brad.jpg\" alt=\"Florin Brad\"\n    title=\"Florin Brad giving the tour.\" height=520 /></p>\n<p>In Florin’s own words:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThis year I held a five minute presentation about Romania during the opening\nof the summer school. They say the best way to learn something is to explain\nit to other people, so I hope people have learned one or two things about our\ncountry (because I sure have).\n<footer>\nFlorin Brad, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-lectures\">The lectures</h2>\n<p>The lectures at EEML covered a broad range of topics in Machine Learning\naiming to both build the theoretical foundations for the newcomers and also\nhint to the research frontiers in the domain.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the diverse background of the speakers enabled a wide variety of\nlectures, ranging from pragmatic descriptions of the latest research results\nto theoretical crash courses in the different areas covered by the summer\nschool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"posters\">Posters</h2>\n<p>EEML participants were encouraged to present their current work in a poster\nsession that spanned over two evenings (actually well into the night). That\nwas a great opportunity for them to get feedback from the seniors.</p>\n<blockquote>\nIt was a great opportunity to present my work at EEML, getting a chance to\nshare opinions with amazing people with varied expertise in computer vision.\nThis experience had a positive impact and helped me shape my next research\nsteps as many discussions brought a new perspective over my work.\n<footer>\nEmanuela Haller, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our team unveiled three internal research efforts. Iulia Duță and Andrei\nNicolicioiu presented their novel recurrent space-time graph neural networks\nfor video understanding (also accepted at NeurIPS!!!). Emanuela Haller\ndiscussed her work on spacetime graph optimization for video object\nsegmentation. Florin Gogianu introduced his idea to use uncertainty to\nprioritize past experiences for training agents through reinforcement\nlearning.</p>\n<blockquote>\nEEML also provided me with the opportunity of presenting my work on\nBayesian-inspired prioritization measures for the Experience Replay buffer\nduring one of the two poster sessions. It was actually my first\nconference-like poster session I attended so it was a rather interesting\nexperience. I received some great suggestions from Diana Borsa which might\nhelp me polish this research further and also got some follow-up questions\nfrom the people I met there. Somehow I also got one of the Best Poster Awards\nand that wrapped-up nicely the great experience I had attending EEML.\n<footer>\nFlorin Gogianu, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"teaching-assistants\">Teaching assistants</h2>\n<p>EEML practicals were challenging applications of the theory discussed during\nthe lectures. The subjects were quite diverse covering Image classification,\nreinforcement learning, recurrent neural nets for language models, or\ngenerative models such as variational autoencoders. The teaching assistants\nhad the job to guide the participants into solving this tasks, and leave the\nsummer school with a consistent experience in training deep neural models\nusing Tensorflow. The TAs were researchers from prestigious universities, and\ncompanies such as DeepMind, and Bitdefender.</p>\n<blockquote>\nFor me, it was quite a different perspective this time, as I join the summer\nschool as a teaching assistant, an attribution that I loved to hold as it\ngave me the opportunity, besides captivating lectures held by top researchers\nall over the world, to interact more with participants and other TAs. It was\na great mix of receptive students, awesome devoted colleagues and a strong\nteam behind all the labs that prepares everything to be fun and valuable._\n<footer>\nIulia Duță, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>Our own colleagues, some of which are also teaching at University Politehnica\nof Bucharest or University of Bucharest (Iulia, Florin, Andrei, Ștefan, Ema,\nTudor) got involved in guiding the participants through the new stuff in each\nlaboratory.</p>\n<blockquote>\nI am a teaching assistant at the university, but here it was way more\nchallenging given the hard topics and the smart and enthusiastic people\nattending. Brilliant researchers were also acting as teaching assistants and\nI really appreciate interacting with them during and before the labs. It was\nvery interesting to see how other TAs explain the topics they are experts\non. \n<footer>\nAndrei Nicolicioiu, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"epilogue\">Epilogue</h2>\n<p>EEML was a huge opportunity for Bucharest to join and interact with the\nrelevant actors in the machine learning community. Bitdefender is proud to be\nso deeply involved in bringing this event to our city.</p>\n<blockquote>\nFacilitating new relations between like-minded researchers at the beginning\nof their careers is not the only thing making EEML great. I felt I gained a\nlot by participating or assisting in discussions with researchers like Răzvan\nPașcanu, Doina Precup, Andrei Rusu or Akata Zeynep. Simply hanging around\nthese people and hear them discussing any topic for 20 minutes can leave you\nwith tons of insights and problem formulations they've deeply thought about\nand to which you could not have access to otherwise.\n<footer>\nFlorin Gogianu, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n"},"galleries":{"courses":[{"src":"/galleries/courses/atari_mixtape.png","width":900,"height":1273},{"src":"/galleries/courses/campus.jpg","width":725,"height":1080},{"src":"/galleries/courses/overview_bitdefender.jpg","width":1959,"height":2813},{"src":"/galleries/courses/overview_crypto.jpg","width":1920,"height":960},{"src":"/galleries/courses/overview_fmi.jpg","width":768,"height":600},{"src":"/galleries/courses/overview_pm.png","width":1194,"height":1190},{"src":"/galleries/courses/thumb_bitdefender.png","width":128,"height":128},{"src":"/galleries/courses/thumb_precis.jpg","width":128,"height":128},{"src":"/galleries/courses/thumb_rosedu.png","width":360,"height":360},{"src":"/galleries/courses/thumb_unibuc.png","width":1024,"height":1024}],"deep_bit_2019_pictures":[{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_150323.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_150331.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_153111.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_153118.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_164741.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/20190731_164747.jpg","width":4032,"height":1960},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_142509.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_142514.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_142521.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_142523_1.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_142925.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_144034.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145138.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145146.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145644.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145647.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145650.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_pictures/IMG_20190731_145654.jpg","width":4160,"height":3120}],"deep_bit_2019_posters":[{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_alin_passwords.png","width":4965,"height":7021},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_bogdan_train_with_private_data.png","width":7200,"height":5400},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_cristi_stegano.png","width":2480,"height":3507},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_elena+adi_adversarial.png","width":4965,"height":7021},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_horia+alin_homoglyph.png","width":6300,"height":4875},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_mada_crypto_nets.png","width":4965,"height":7021},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_mircescu_MRI.png","width":2480,"height":3507},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_novac_logs_anomalies.png","width":4965,"height":7021},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_tudor_fake_news.png","width":4965,"height":7021},{"src":"/galleries/deep_bit_2019_posters/poster_vlad_mouse_auth.png","width":4965,"height":7021}],"deep_fmi_2019_posters":[{"src":"/galleries/deep_fmi_2019_posters/10.
