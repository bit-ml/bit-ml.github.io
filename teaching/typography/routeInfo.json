It was actually my first\nconference-like poster session I attended so it was a rather interesting\nexperience. I received some great suggestions from Diana Borsa which might\nhelp me polish this research further and also got some follow-up questions\nfrom the people I met there. Somehow I also got one of the Best Poster Awards\nand that wrapped-up nicely the great experience I had attending EEML.\n<footer>\nFlorin Gogianu, Bitdefender\n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n"}}}
