It is an optional course primarily (but not exclusively) for\nthird-year undergraduates of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,\nUniversity of Bucharest. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training\nneural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural\nlanguage understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs,\nassignments and the final project. <strong>The second edition of the course is about to start (on February 19th).\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/pFSUmhcpJktkuWuMA\">Enroll now!</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Basic Python knowledge or several years as a programmer and\neagerness to start understanding Deep Learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Course Team</strong>: Emanuela Haller, Florin Gogianu, Andrei Nicolicioiu, Iulia Duta, Florin Brad, Elena Burceanu, Andrei Manolache, Covaci Adrian</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"syllabus\">Syllabus</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to Deep Learning<ul>\n<li><strong>Lab1: Intro to Python, PyTorch and Tensors</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Neural Nets</li>\n<li>Optimization<ul>\n<li><strong>Lab2: Training and Optimization</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Assignment1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>\n<li>Computer Vision applications<ul>\n<li><strong>Lab3: CNN on images</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Assignment2: Count digits in an image</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recurrent NN</li>\n<li>Natural Language Processing applications<ul>\n<li><strong>Lab4: RNNs on language</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unsupervised Learning Models</li>\n<li>PROJECT Status<ul>\n<li><strong>Lab5: Verify Assignments</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Poster Session with the PROJECTs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on the last year course experience, this second edition will focus less\non evaluating the theoretical aspects and will have less payload for the end\nof the semester.
