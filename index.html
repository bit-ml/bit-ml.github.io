Video object segmentation and object discovery are strongly related tasks, but we tackle the problem from a fully unsupervised perspective, building object representations from raw video sequences. An efficient solution to this task would enable large-scale video interpretation at a high semantic level in the absence of the costly manual labeling.</p><p class="Project__Text-d9zx3a-3 xFCli">We are focused on generating foreground object soft masks based on automatic selection and learning from highly probable positive features. We show that such features can be selected efficiently by taking into consideration the spatio-temporal appearance and motion consistency of the object in the video sequence. We also emphasize the role of the contrasting properties between the foreground object and its background. Our work is also focused on theoretically proving the properties of our unsupervised learning method, which under some mild constraints is guaranteed to learn the correct classifier even in the unsupervised case.</p><ul class="Project__BibList-d9zx3a-4 kdLuCp"><li class="Project__BibItem-d9zx3a-5 fQZxgf"><a class="Project__BibLink-d9zx3a-6 aGFSx" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05674" target="_blank"><span class="Project__BibAuthors-d9zx3a-7 OMggx">E.

An efficient solution to this task would enable large-scale video interpretation at a high semantic level in the absence of the costly manual labeling.\nWe are focused on generating foreground object soft masks based on automatic selection and learning from highly probable positive features. We show that such features can be selected efficiently by taking into consideration the spatio-temporal appearance and motion consistency of the object in the video sequence. We also emphasize the role of the contrasting properties between the foreground object and its background.

To overcome limitations of the task and the available data, we design multiple models, to explore different video encoding strategies, to explore intermediate video-language representation and to investigate the gains brought by additional tasks and features. We propose a method for video captioning by selecting from the results of multiple encoder-decoder models.

Difficulties could come from severe changes in object appearance, presence of background clutter and occlusions that might take place in the video.\nThe only ground-truth knowledge given to the tracker is the bounding box of the object in the first frame. Thus, without knowing in advance the properties of the object being tracked, the tracking algorithm must learn them on the fly.

A detailed\nprogram can be found here tmlss.ro/programme.php.</p>\n<p>Even though there were six full and exhausting days, our team really enjoyed it\nand tried to get the most out of the lecturers and from the interactions with\nthe participants and the lecturers. Bitdefender was very well represented and\nwe came back home inspired and eager to continue our research.  More, we also\ngot a Best Poster award for Computer Vision (yey!).</p>\n<p>Actually our team enjoyed this experience so much that some of them decided to\ngive an individual account of some of the highlights of TMLSS2018 and the\nlectures that gave them a long lasting impression.</p>\n<p><strong>Tudor Berariu</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>The Transylvanian Machine Learning Summer School represents the perfect venue\nfor all who are interested in pursuing a research career in machine learning.\nFor those that are yet unfamiliar with the field TMLLSS gives the chance to\ngrasp the fundamental theory of a broad set of core topics. At the same time,\nthe more experienced participants are being offered a glimpse of the top\nresearchers’ reflections on the open problems in the field. All in all, Cluj\nwas the place to be this July if interested in machine learning.</em></p>\n<p><em>Amidst all those captivating lectures spanned over six days one caught my eye\nin particular: <strong>Ulrich Paquet’s</strong> introduction to Variational Autoencoders.\nAlthough I held some lectures on the topic myself in the past years, I found\nUlrich’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xTsnNcctvmU\">presentation</a> remarkable for its\nconcise, visual, extremely clear, while at the same time strongly theoretical\nelucidation of what and how VAEs do achieve. I wish my lectures were half as\ngood as his.</em></p>\n<p><em>Later that day, while visiting the boring salt mine near Turda, I also had the\nchance to chat with Ulrich and ask him a few questions regarding generative\nmodels, especially Boltzmann Machines. His exact words <em>Do not give up research\non Boltzmann Machines.</em> convinced me to recommence my efforts on training\ndifferent flavours of energy-based models to structure knowledge in\nreinforcement learning setups.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Iulia Duță</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>The main focus of the summer school was to popularize the machine learning\nfields in Eastern Europe, so the lectures’ content was a mixture of\nintroductory and more advanced topics. Knowing that beforehand, I arrived in\nCluj both with the goal of capturing speaker’s intuitions on fundamental\nconcepts in machine learning and insights on open, more recent challenges in\nthe field.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the lectures that I remarked as being well structured and\ncreated exactly for this purpose was <strong>Dumitru Erhan’s</strong> presentation: “Computer\nVision: Way  Beyond  Classification”. He build the lecture incrementally, from\na classical computer vision problem (Object Detection) to a much hotter topic\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05424\">Domain Adaptation</a>. Both of them were\npresented in terms of how the field evolved over time, highlighting advantages\nand disadvantages of each approaches. While the first part addresses a common\nproblem for computer vision researchers, Domain adaptation is a topic\nextremely important for all machine learning subfields, being a worth studying\nopen problem. So besides useful knowledge and interactions, TMLSS showed us a\nglimpse of novel research and a long bibliography to follow.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Andrei Nicolicioiu</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>The lecture that impressed me the most was the one about Graph Networks\npresented by <strong>Răzvan Pașcanu</strong>. He showed intuitions about the priors existing\nin deep networks and the need for models better suited for domains having\nstrong <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261v2\">relational priors</a>. We were\npresented in a unified way different views of the domain from general graph\nnetworks to simpler graph convolutional architectures, showing the usefulness\nof relations both in problems involving data with a more obvious graph\nstructure as molecules and in unexpected places like the interactions of\nmemories in a recurrent model. The presentation certainly inspired me to study\nmore about these approaches and how can they be applied in my research.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dana Axinte</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Neural networks, gradients, posters, enthusiasm, magic. These are some of the\nsettings of the first Transylvanian Machine Learning Summer School held in\nCluj, Romania. Looking through the schedule and speakers, I expected the school\nto be strong and that I would have the chance to settle new concepts while I\nwould engage with other participants with different backgrounds, but same\ninterests.</em></p>\n<p><em>I liked the balance between theoretically focused lectures and the ones that\npresented the industry usage of those concepts. Such pair of lectures that I\nparticularly appreciated were the ones by <strong>Doina Precup</strong> who took a\nprogressive approach in presenting value-based methods with function\napproximation for reinforcement learning and the one of <strong>Raia Hadsell</strong> who\nshowed how deep reinforcement learning can be applied into\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04286v2\">robotics</a>, with the challenges that exists\nand the possible <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00168v2\">solutions</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the parts of the summer school that I especially enjoyed was the panel\nsession where some lecturers shared their opinion on different interesting\ntopics. The reproducibility of experiments, the future of AI research and\nadvices to increase the local AI ecosystems, as what could be the involvement\nof governments, companies and teachers were few of the issues discussed. There\nwere no hype or buzzwords, but the lecturers were people who know today’s\nlimitations, needs and questions and get things done step by step, with an\nengineering mindset. A fundamental feeling with which I left is that it is not\nonly about learning, but sharing the experience and knowledge gained to empower\nothers to create and to strengthen the community and motivation.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h3>\n<p>It was only the first edition, but every detail was at a very high standard. In\nthe last days, we presented with Traian Rebedea the advantages of having the\nnext Summer School edition here in Bucharest. Looking forward to TMLSS2019 :)</p>\n"}]},"siteData":{"title":"Bitdefender Machine Learning & Crypto Research Unit","description":"Bitdefender Machine Learning & Crypto Research Unit goals are to further the fields of machine learning and criptography while engaging with the international research community and to develop the local AI&ML scene by supporting and participating in local conferences, lecture and research groups.","tagline":"Engaging with the broader Machine Learning Community.","tags":["machine-learning","research","bitdefender"]}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bit-ml.github.io/bootstrap.c505fd7e.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bit-ml.github.io/templates/src/pages/Home.6e73cd60.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="https://bit-ml.github.io/main.774a44b1.js"></script></body></html>
