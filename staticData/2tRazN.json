From over\n800 participants, only 100 were selected to participate and to present a poster\nwith his/hers research results or work in progress. The diversity of the\nparticipants was an important keypoint in the selection, roughly half of the\nparticipants were Romanians.</p>\n<p>The setup was the following: In each day we had a several lectures (from\nintroductory to more advanced ones) and at the end of the day we had lab\nsessions (Math, Computer Vision, Language, Generative Models, Unsupervised\nLearning and Reinforcement Learning). At the poster sessions, each of us had up\nto 4h30 to present the poster to anyone interested of if from the school. A\ndetailed program can be found here tmlss.ro/programme.php.</p>\n<p>Even though there were 6 full and exhausting days, our team really enjoyed it\nand tried to get the most out of the lecturers and from the interactions with\nthe participants and the lecturers (mainly DeepMind researchers). Bitdefender\nwas very well represented (8 of us were there) and we come home inspired and\neager to continue our research. More, we also get a Best Poster award for\nComputer Vision (yey!).</p>\n<p>It was only the first edition, but every detail was at a very high standard. In\nthe last days, we presented with Traian Rebedea the advantages of having the\nnext Summer School edition here in Bucharest. Looking forward to TMLSS2019 :)</p>\n"}]
